		<p>
			In August, I composed a piano trio for Dustin Seo<br>
			and Marika Suzuki, and a little piece
			for <a href="https://www.mivosquartet.com">Mivos <br> Quartet</a>
			in July. In the past, I've worked with members<br> of
		 	<a href="https://www.newmusicusa.org/profile/talea-ensemble/">Talea Ensemble</a>, 
		 	<a href="https://www.takensemble.com">TAK Ensemble</a>, and
		 	<a href="https://wetink.org">Wet Ink</a>.<br>
